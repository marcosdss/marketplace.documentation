# Oba Hortifruti - Developer Space

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 2 minutes**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [NVM for windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

> I recommend installing nvm instead of installing a fixed version of npm

## Starting localhost

Run the development server:

```bash
cd oba.documentation
yarn start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. You'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
